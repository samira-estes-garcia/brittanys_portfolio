        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>What does the brain look like when we’re able to be productive?</p>
        <p>Most productivity apps on the market aren’t effective for their users
          because they don’t take something very important into account – how
          the brain works.
        </p>
        <p>When in a negative state, it’s hard for the brain to
          process and reflect, or be productive. Positive emotions are key. It’s
          not always possible to feel them, but it is possible to cultivate
          them.

      <p><span class="semi-bold">Two main groups of people emerged from the research – those that are motivated
        by internal factors, and those that are motivated by external factors like other
        people.</span> Internal factors included bettering their life, learning and growing, and
        meeting personal deadlines. External factors were about other people, but specifically
        concerned helping others and bettering others’ lives, or getting motivation from
        encouragement and support from loved ones. I called them people-motivated and
        self-motivated, and these became my empathy maps and personas.
      </p>
      <p>People were also motivated by seeing and tracking their progress, and by rewards. It
          was easier to accomplish a task when they had seen the work they had already
          accomplished, and it was even better if they got something beneficial out of it.

      <p><span class="semi-bold">I was focusing on motivation, but more than just motivation came out of my
        research. What helps people be productive, not just be motivated to be productive?</span>
        One was being able to order their tasks based on difficulty level, as well as being able
        to break their tasks down into manageable chunks, and most obviously, making a lot
        of lists. 
      </p>
      <p><span class="semi-bold">What frustrates them?</span> Time management issues. Not being able to focus. Getting
        overwhelmed. Forgetting things
      </p>
      <p><span class="semi-bold">And what about productivity apps themselves?</span> There’s not enough freedom or room
        to express themselves. They have to use a lot of different productivity apps, because
        each one only does one thing right for them. They’re too complicated. 
      </p>

      <h1>Give the People What They <span class="cross-out">Want</span> Need</h1>
      <p>
        To begin the design process, I did a competitive analysis. I concentrated on what had
        presented itself in the research. Several apps had been mentioned by participants.
        What other apps were out there, how were these apps not fulfilling the needs of
        users, what were they doing right, and how could I use that information to best
        design Motivatask?
      </p>
      <p>
        I focused on the issues that had come up combined with Nielsen Norman Group
        principles, such as user control and freedom. Just like in my research, I found that
        many apps were lacking in that department, such as the popular Evernote. Other
        apps like Habitica had good examples of giving users rewards – it was something I
        used for inspiration as I started thinking of ideas and putting together my early
        sketches, below. 
      </p>
      <img class="sketch" src="assets/people-sketch.png" alt="User Persona Solution Sketch">
      <img class="sketch sketch-2" src="assets/obstacles-sketch.png" alt="Encountering Obstacles Sketch">
      <p>
        <span class="semi-bold">I started with ideas that would help both people-motivated and self-motivated
          users.</span> I thought about rewards like medals, trophies, and milestones. The peoplemotivated users could share them with friends, and the self-motivated users would
          have them for self-satisfaction. People-motivated users could “amp each other up or
          encourage each other” as I talked about in my early notes, and self-motivated users
          could gain access to new features. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I originally thought of a social network format. When users shared their achievements
        with friends, they would show up in a feed where there would be typical features
        such as liking, commenting, and reacting. There would be some kind of recognition/
        spotlight concept, where users could have “accountability buddies”. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="semi-bold">For tracking progress, users could view data visualization. </span>Other early ideas for
        supporting people when encountering obstacles were support forums and
        inspirational quotes and videos. 
      </p>
      <p><span class="semi-bold">To simplify work processes, </span>I came up with “Plan My Day” – this allows users to
        organize tasks based on priority. I also wanted to be able to break tasks down into
        manageable chunks, such as through pre-made templates and sub-tasks.
      </p>
      <p><span class="semi-bold">To make it so that users wouldn’t have to use multiple productivity apps,</span>
        I tried to combine many features like a timer/time tracker, a to-do list section, reminders with a
        calendar, a free area for notes and brainstorming, and post-its. Here is a quote from
        my early notes -- “The goal would be that users wouldn’t have to use any other
        productivity app. This would have to be done in a way so that all of the features are
        done well and not neglected, and the app doesn’t have a cluttered interface. The app
        would also have to be customizable to fulfill many different kinds of users’ needs.” The
        notes area was a homage to the need for freedom and for users to express
        themselves. 
      </p>
      <p>I made sketches based on these ideas to show to users and get feedback for the
        direction I should move forward in. </p>

      <h1>Moving in the Right Direction…</h1>
      <p><span class="semi-bold">The users are the experts, and doing guerilla user testing was so enlightening.</span> I
        realized I had almost become a victim of feature creep. However, I could still give
        users an effective all-in-one app without including absolutely everything. </p>
      <p><span class="semi-bold">I removed the features that participants didn’t see as useful</span> – the calendar, the timer,
        and the post-its. Instead, I added in deadlines and reminders for tasks. I scrapped the
        feed – users were interested in social features but didn’t want it to be like a social
        media platform. Connecting the app to already existing social media made more
        sense for sharing.</p>
      <p>Users thought it was great to be able to work together with friends in the app though,
        such as by collaborating on note boards and tasks with them. Challenges with friends
        were mentioned a lot as a way to have some kind of accountability to other people
        and having to check in, instead of accountability buddies. Motivating and getting
        motivated by friends was very positively received.</p>
      <p>I had gotten off track with the focus on motivation and hadn’t sketched out enough
        of that in detail. I thought about motivational responses for completing tasks and
        motivational messages on the home screen. I came up with a “Motivational Message
        of the Day”.</p>

      <h1>An Improved Idea</h1>
      <p>With all of the knowledge from my guerilla user testing, I worked on wireframes in
        Sketch to better communicate my ideas and focus on the direction I was moving in. <span class="semi-bold">I
        focused on three main features – Tasks, Notes, and Friends.</span> Through Tasks, users are
        able to make to-do lists and individual tasks and add priority levels, additional notes,
        and deadlines. At the time, they were also able to add tags. They can view their tasks
        based on deadline, i.e. “Due Today” and “Due Soon” and get reminders on their home
        screen. The priority levels are for a “Plan My Day” feature that allows users to structure
        their day based on priority.</p>
      <p>They get rewards in the form of achievements and motivational messages for
        finishing these tasks. Users will be able to view their progress through data
        visualization and also all of their achievements in one secure place. </p>
      <p>Notes is a way to have complete freedom – it’s like a notebook. Users can write in
        pencil, pen, and marker, or regular text, as well as add photos. Most recent notes show
        up on the home screen. Finally, in Friends, users can challenge their friends and send
        and receive motivational messages. </p>
      <p>I was super excited to show these to participants for usability testing. In comparison
        to my sketches, they barely looked like the same application. </p>

      <h1>Taking It to the Next Level</h1>
      <p>It was now time to work on the style.</p>
      <p>I knew that for this project I wanted to communicate happiness and vibrance.
        Productivity comes from positive feelings for the brain, after all. I concentrated on
        bright colors, including a signature bright blue that became the main brand color,
        and illustrations – no photographs. I incorporated other bright colors into all of the
        illustrations, such as a beautiful bright red, green, and yellow. <span class="semi-bold">At Motivatask, we want
        to communicate energy, positivity, friendliness, and obviously motivation through
        our colors and illustrations. And also fun!</span> I documented this in a mood board and
        style guide.</p>
      <div class="style-container">

        <p>The name Motivatask is a play on words, combining task and motivation. The
          logo uses the signature blue and a check mark, to clearly communicate what
          it’s about. </p>

          accessibility audit on them, specifically focusing on visual issues. What good is
          an app if only certain people can use it? I changed some colors and then moved
          onto Figma for prototyping.</p>

      </div>
      <p>I conducted two rounds of usability testing – each with five people, using a usability
        testing script I created. The first round turned up some concerns. For example,
        participants didn’t know if the “Motivational Message of the Day” was clickable or not.
        I had made it into a card, but there was no button, arrow, or any other indicator that it
        was interactive. There was a similar problem for the links under Tasks and Notes on
        the home screen. </p>
      <p>The icons for the individual tasks were confusing. The users didn’t understand the
          labeling icon or the function of it, and the clock was seen as unclear. This was also
          true for “projects” – something I had included alongside tasks and to-do lists under
          Tasks, as a way to have multiple to-do lists together.</p>
      <p>The system for messages needed to be changed. When tapping on the Friends tab,
        users could see if anyone sent them a message because a notification popped up.
        This turned out to be easy to miss. Users also wanted to be able to see more of the
        messaging system such as being able to view their old and sent messages. </p>
      <p>There were a few other minor things, such as making the delete function more
        accessible and obvious, changing the way note boards were organized, and fleshing
        out the prototype more.</p>

      </div>
      <p>I got to work on all of the issues that had presented themselves, and also tweaked
        little things – like the sizes of buttons – to give the overall look and feel of the app an
        upgrade. </p>
      <p>I added the word “View” with an arrow icon onto the “Motivational Message of the
        Day” and made the links on the home screen a version of the signature blue to make
        it clear what was interactive. </p>
      <p>I took out the tagging system and changed the clock icon to a calendar to make it
        clear that it was about deadlines. I removed projects and decided to focus on tasks
        and to-do lists instead. </p>
      <p>I also changed the messaging system to include an inbox where users could view
        their new, old, and sent messages. The challenges were originally under the account
        information, so I moved them to Friends and gave them a similar setup with sent,
        active, and completed challenges as well as challenge requests. </p>
      <p>I brought the option to delete out in the open and changed it into a trash can icon. I
        also switched from a big save button to an auto-save feature, based on testing results.
        I fleshed out the prototype a lot more by adding a way to try out all of the tools in the
        note boards, for example. The note boards organization turned into a scroll feature
        instead of a carousel with a “View All” button. </p>
      <div id="iframe">
        <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2FNTcNInYzoNHepPvsHD0y8D%2FMotivatask%3Fnode-id%3D0%253A2947%26scaling%3Dscale-down-width" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      </div>
      <p>Thankfully, the second round of testing went really smooth, with no issues. I did do
        further tweaking though, such as putting more space between the trash icon and the
        deadlines icon so that the destructive action wasn’t accidentally hit. It’s all about the details! View my prototype above.</p>
      <p>Overall, there was an overwhelmingly positive response. Many people contacted me asking when the app would be available for download, saying they could see the app becoming a “core part of their lives”. It was described as “colorful, engaging, and eye-catching” and one person said just looking at it made her feel happy.</p>

      <h1>Reflections & Next Steps</h1>
      <p>I learned so much from creating “Motivatask”, mainly that <span class="semi-bold">without research, good
        design doesn’t exist. It’s extremely important to listen to the audience and design
        for them.</span> Designers often get caught up in their own personal subjectivities, but it’s
        important to remember that we’re not the users. </p>
      <p>Personal experience can definitely serve as inspiration though. When my mom
        passed away, I was the sole person in charge of her estate. I had a million things to do,
        and was grieving while trying to do them. I tried to use productivity apps, but they
        just made me feel worse as I checked off items on lists that never seemed to shrink. </p>
      <p><span class="semi-bold">My dream for this app is that it will help people, regardless of whether their task is
        something major like what I had to accomplish or something much smaller.</span></p>
      <p>Overall, it was really enjoyable taking an application and designing it from end-toend. There were definitely challenges because of COVID-19 – doing all testing virtually
        proposed its own restrictions. I’m proud of the work that I accomplished and can’t
        wait to see what happens next!</p>
      <p>Currently, I’m working with a developer to bring this app to life using mySQL and

        Friends section and providing more sophisticated data visualization for showing
        progress. </p>
