        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>What does the brain look like when we’re able to be productive?</p>
        <p>Most productivity apps on the market aren’t effective for their users
          because they don’t take something very important into account – how
          the brain works.
        </p>
        <p>When in a negative state, it’s hard for the brain to
          process and reflect, or be productive. Positive emotions are key. It’s
          not always possible to feel them, but it is possible to cultivate
          them.

      <p><b>Two main groups of people emerged from the research – those that are motivated
        by internal factors, and those that are motivated by external factors like other
        people.</b> Internal factors included bettering their life, learning and growing, and
        meeting personal deadlines. External factors were about other people, but specifically
        concerned helping others and bettering others’ lives, or getting motivation from
        encouragement and support from loved ones. I called them people-motivated and
        self-motivated, and these became my empathy maps and personas.
      </p>
      <p>People were also motivated by seeing and tracking their progress, and by rewards. It
          was easier to accomplish a task when they had seen the work they had already
          accomplished, and it was even better if they got something beneficial out of it.

      <p><b>I was focusing on motivation, but more than just motivation came out of my
        research. What helps people be productive, not just be motivated to be productive?</b>
        One was being able to order their tasks based on difficulty level, as well as being able
        to break their tasks down into manageable chunks, and most obviously, making a lot
        of lists. 
      </p>
      <p><b>What frustrates them?</b> Time management issues. Not being able to focus. Getting
        overwhelmed. Forgetting things
      </p>
      <p><b>And what about productivity apps themselves?</b> There’s not enough freedom or room
        to express themselves. They have to use a lot of different productivity apps, because
        each one only does one thing right for them. They’re too complicated. 
      </p>
      <p>I analyzed all of this information via affinity mapping.</p>

      <h1>Give the People What They <span class="cross-out">Want</span> Need</h1>
      <p>
        To begin the design process, I did a competitive analysis. I concentrated on what had
        presented itself in the research. Several apps had been mentioned by participants.
        What other apps were out there, how were these apps not fulfilling the needs of
        users, what were they doing right, and how could I use that information to best
        design Motivatask?
      </p>
      <p>
        I focused on the issues that had come up combined with Nielsen Norman Group
        principles, such as user control and freedom. Just like in my research, I found that
        many apps were lacking in that department, such as the popular Evernote. Other
        apps like Habitica had good examples of giving users rewards – it was something I
        used for inspiration as I started thinking of ideas and putting together my early
        sketches, below. 
      </p>
      <img src="">

      <p>
        <b>I started with ideas that would help both people-motivated and self-motivated
          users.</b> I thought about rewards like medals, trophies, and milestones. The peoplemotivated users could share them with friends, and the self-motivated users would
          have them for self-satisfaction. People-motivated users could “amp each other up or
          encourage each other” as I talked about in my early notes, and self-motivated users
          could gain access to new features. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I originally thought of a social network format. When users shared their achievements
        with friends, they would show up in a feed where there would be typical features
        such as liking, commenting, and reacting. There would be some kind of recognition/
        spotlight concept, where users could have “accountability buddies”. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>For tracking progress, users could view data visualization.</b>Other early ideas for
        supporting people when encountering obstacles were support forums and
        inspirational quotes and videos. 
      </p>
      <p><b>To simplify work processes, </b>I came up with “Plan My Day” – this allows users to
        organize tasks based on priority. I also wanted to be able to break tasks down into
        manageable chunks, such as through pre-made templates and sub-tasks.
      </p>
      <p><b>To make it so that users wouldn’t have to use multiple productivity apps,</b>
        I tried to combine many features like a timer/time tracker, a to-do list section, reminders with a
        calendar, a free area for notes and brainstorming, and post-its. Here is a quote from
        my early notes -- “The goal would be that users wouldn’t have to use any other
        productivity app. This would have to be done in a way so that all of the features are
        done well and not neglected, and the app doesn’t have a cluttered interface. The app
        would also have to be customizable to fulfill many different kinds of users’ needs.” The
        notes area was a homage to the need for freedom and for users to express
        themselves. 
      </p>
      <p>I made sketches based on these ideas to show to users and get feedback for the
        direction I should move forward in. </p>
