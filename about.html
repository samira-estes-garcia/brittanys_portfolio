        When I was 7, one of the elderly teachers at my school was set to be
        fired. He was an incredible person, but was slowing down with age and
        the school thought the solution was letting him go. I thought this was
        unjust, unfair, and just plain wrong, so I designed a petition with
        pencil, paper, and crayon, and took it around my school to gather
        signatures.
      </p>
      <p>This is who I am as a designer, and as a person.</p>

        🎓 My undergraduate degree from the University of Texas is in sociology,
        where I learned about human relationships, institutions, and our
        society. I understand people and how culture plays into how we interact
        with the world and the products that I design.
      </p>
      <p>
        👩‍💻 After graduation, I worked in digital marketing. This introduced me
        to graphic design, marketing research, and how making a product the best
        it can be – and listening to its users – makes it successful.
      </p>
      <p>
        🙏 I then came to UX/UI design after my mom passed away. She really
        showed me that “life is too short” is more than just a saying and that
        following your passions is important. Speaking of that, I want to teach
        design as well someday.
      </p>
      <p>
        👩‍🎨 I am a natural problem solver, have always loved tech, and am a
        creative person. I write, play the piano, sing, paint, and am a
        photographer. With my background in sociology and marketing, I know I
        already have a lot of relevant skills to offer as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        ✏️ I’m currently working through Springboard’s UX/UI program and
        Tulane’s Post-Baccalaureate Program in Digital Design – Interactive
        Design while taking on freelance clients. My most recent project is a
        visitor management application for Any Lab Test Now San Antonio.
      </p>
      <p>
        🙌 I’m looking for opportunities in the San Antonio, Texas area or
        remote and can’t wait to start my next adventure!
