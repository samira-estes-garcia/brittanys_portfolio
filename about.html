      When I was 7, one of the elderly teachers at my school was set to be
      fired. He was an incredible person, but was slowing down with age and
      the school thought the solution was letting him go. I thought this was
      unjust and unfair so I decided to solve the problem by designing a petition with
      pencil, paper, and crayon, and took it around my school to gather
      signatures.
    </p>
    <p>This is who I am as a designer, and as a person.</p>

    <p>
      üá∫üá∏ I‚Äôm a UX designer at USAA working on member service representative facing tools and experiences that impact
      the military community.
    </p>
    <p>
      üë©‚Äçüíª Before coming to USAA I worked at PowerSchool, an education company, where I focused on technical projects
      for district administrators. Prior to that I did freelance work with a variety of companies including Any Lab Test
      Now. My work has ranged from designing a visitor management service for medical testing labs to creating a
      motivational productivity application using brain science.
    </p>
    <p>
      üéì I attended the University of Texas at Austin where I graduated with high honors and special honors in
      Sociology. I'm excited to pursue more higher education in the future and would love to teach design someday too!
      I'm passionate about helping new designers and am always available for a chat over tea or on Zoom.
    </p>
    <p>
      üôå Outside of work I love giving back to San Antonio through volunteering and community involvement. I'm on the
      Creative Mornings team and am a mentor at CAST Tech. I also love doing design work for non-profits, spending time
      with my wife and our dog Twinkie, and being active outside. It's common to find me getting lost in a bookstore or
      taking photos somewhere too.
